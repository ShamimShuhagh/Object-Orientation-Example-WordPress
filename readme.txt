#Object Oreintation Example#

This example creates a new 'event' content type that can be used to display additional event meta. 

This content is used in one of my SitePoint examples on object orientation in Wordpress

Create a new directory inside your child theme such as `includes` and then another called `event_showcase` and add the PHP class file and CSS/JS directories.
